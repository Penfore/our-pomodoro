## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues as you might find that the problem has already been reported.

When you create a bug report, please include:
- **A clear and descriptive title**
- **Steps to reproduce** the behavior
- **Expected behavior**
- **Actual behavior**
- **Screenshots** if applicable
- **Device information** (OS, version, etc.)
- **App version** (current: v0.3.3)
- **Notification permissions** (if reporting notification issues)
- **Platform-specific details** (Android API level, iOS version)

### Suggesting Enhancements

- **A clear and descriptive title**
- **A detailed description** of the suggested enhancement
- **The motivation** for the enhancement
- **Examples** of how the enhancement would be used

### Code Contributions

#### Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled `good first issue` if you're new to the project.

#### Areas Where We Need Help

- UI/UX improvements
- iOS native interface implementation (Cupertino widgets)
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Performance optimizations
- Testing coverage (especially cross-platform notification testing)
- Documentation
- Accessibility features
- Internationalization (additional languages beyond Portuguese)
- Sound themes and audio enhancements

## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We use a simplified Git flow:
- `main` - Production ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name` - Feature branches
- `bugfix/bug-description` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/critical-fix` - Critical fixes

### Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

3. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request

## Style Guidelines

### Dart Code Style

We follow the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guidelines:

- Use `dart format` to format your code
- Run `flutter analyze` before committing
- Follow the existing code patterns in the project

### Architecture Guidelines

- Follow Clean Architecture principles
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Use dependency injection
- Write testable code
- Keep business logic in use cases
- Use BLoC for state management

- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
feat(timer): add pause functionality
