## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues as you might find that the problem has already been reported.

When you create a bug report, please include:
- **A clear and descriptive title**
- **Steps to reproduce** the behavior
- **Expected behavior**
- **Actual behavior**
- **Screenshots** if applicable
- **Device information** (OS, version, etc.)
- **App version** (current: v0.3.3)
- **Notification permissions** (if reporting notification issues)
- **Platform-specific details** (Android API level, iOS version)

### Suggesting Enhancements

- **A clear and descriptive title**
- **A detailed description** of the suggested enhancement
- **The motivation** for the enhancement
- **Examples** of how the enhancement would be used

### Code Contributions

#### Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled `good first issue` if you're new to the project.

#### Areas Where We Need Help

- UI/UX improvements
- iOS native interface implementation (Cupertino widgets)
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Performance optimizations
- Testing coverage (especially cross-platform notification testing)
- Documentation
- Accessibility features
- Internationalization (additional languages beyond Portuguese)
- Sound themes and audio enhancements

## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We use a simplified Git flow:
- `main` - Production ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name` - Feature branches
- `bugfix/bug-description` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/critical-fix` - Critical fixes

### Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

3. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request

## Style Guidelines

### Dart Code Style

We follow the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guidelines:

- Use `dart format` to format your code
- Run `flutter analyze` before committing
- Follow the existing code patterns in the project

### Architecture Guidelines

- Follow Clean Architecture principles
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Use dependency injection
- Write testable code
- Keep business logic in use cases
- Use BLoC for state management

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Commit Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
feat(timer): add pause functionality
feat(notifications): implement robust permission handling
fix(notifications): resolve notification not showing on real devices
fix(settings): platform-specific notification testing
docs(readme): update screenshots with new features
test(notifications): add cross-platform notification tests
chore(deps): update flutter_local_notifications to latest version
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. Ensure your code follows the style guidelines
2. Run `flutter analyze` and fix any issues

4. Test on both Android and iOS if possible (especially for notification features)
5. Add tests for new functionality
6. Update documentation if needed
7. Test notification permissions on real devices when applicable
8. Rebase your branch on the latest `develop`

### Pull Request Template

When creating a PR, please include:
