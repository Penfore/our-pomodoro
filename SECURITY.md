## Reporting a Vulnerability

While Our Pomodoro is not a security-critical application, we understand our responsibility as an open source project to address security concerns when they arise.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: fulvioleo.dev@pm.me

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

- We will review and respond to vulnerability reports on a best-effort basis
- We will work with you to understand and validate the vulnerability when possible
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Update Process

When security issues are confirmed, we will:
1. Assess the severity and impact of the vulnerability
2. Develop and test appropriate fixes
3. Release updates as feasible
4. Publish security advisories when appropriate

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English or Portuguese.

## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not access, modify, or store user data
- Contact us immediately if you inadvertently encounter user data

Thank you for helping keep Our Pomodoro and our users safe!
